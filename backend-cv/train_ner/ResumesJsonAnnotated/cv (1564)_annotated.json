Seeking for the good opportunity\nwhere I can train my self professionally and personally in a desirable\nmanner.\nWorking Experience\nSushilhari International Residential School  (CBSE Board)( From June\n2014 to Till now)\nWorking as a Teacher handling 9th & 10th standard Physics.\nEducational Qualification\nDegree                         Master of Science (75%)\nUniversity                    GANDHIGRAM RURAL UNIVERSITY (DEEMED) \nREGULAR.\nMajor                           PHYSICS\nDuration                      2011-2013\nDegree                         Bachelor of Science  (First Class 71%)\nUniversity                    GANDHIGRAM RURAL UNIVERSITY (DEEMED) \nREGULAR.\nMajor                           PHYSICS\nDuration                      2007-2010\nDegree                          Bachelor of education (First class 79%)\nUniversity                     GANDHIGRAM RURAL UNIVERSITY (DEEMED) \nREGULAR.\nMajor                             Education\nDuration                        2010-2011\n   Project submitted (M.SC - 2011):  \nTitle: Synthesis, Structural and Spectroscopic Investigations on\nSamarium Doped Alkali Lead Boro-Tellurite Glasses.\n                              \nObjective:         The objective of this project is to study the structural and optical \nbehavior of Samarium doped alkali lead boro-tellurite glasses.\nMethodology:  We adopted melting of the mixture method.\nAnalysis used:  We used Luminescence, Radiative Parameters and Judd-\nOfelt Analysis.\nSummary:                      \nThe starting materials used in this study are of 99.9% purity.\nAfter mixing the reaction mixture is transferred to a porcelain crucible then it\nis fired for an hour at 950˚C in the furnace which leads to the formation of \nmolten flex.\nThen, it was poured on a hot copper plate maintains at temperature of 300˚C\nin another furnace and kept for 8 hours to enhance the mechanical strength \nand the quality of glass prepared.\nThe prepared glass samples were checked for the amorphous nature using X-\nRay powder diffraction technique.\nWe used FTIR method to determine the vibration spectra.\nThen, absorption spectra are determined using U-V Visible Spectrometer.\nTo find Optical absorption we used luminescence / Fluorescence \nSpectrophotometer.\nFrom this we have determined the physical properties such as Density, \nRefractive index, Rare earth ion concentration, polaron radius, inter ionic \ndistance, field strength, electronic polarizablity, molar refractivity, di-electric \nconstant, and reflection losses.\nConclusion:\nFinally the XRD pattern confirms amorphous nature of glass.\nThe  IR  Spectra  indicates  the  presence  of  quite  significant  –  OH\nstretching  vibrations,  B-O  bonds  of  trigonal  BO3  units  and  the\nvibrations of B-O-B linkages in the borate network.\nThe Te-O bonds stretching vibrations in Te-O3 & Te-O4 units also been\nidentified and reported.\nThe  ionic character has been confirmed through  optical absorption\nspectra.\nThe  Jude-OFelt  parameters  ῼ2,  ῼ4,  ῼ6  were  derived  from  the\nabsorption spectra.\nThe intense reddish orange emission has been observed under 488 nm\nexcitation. Based on this we concluded that glass ‘C’ is used as laser\nactive medium for emission at 600 nm.Project submitted (B.SC - 2007):\nTitle: Magnetic Susceptibility studies on oils for curing prolonged\njoint pain as a consequence of chikkun-gunia.\n                              \nObjective:\n         The objective of this project is to study the magnetic susceptibility of \nthese oils and to determine the best one among these oils to be used to cure\nthe prolonged joint pain.\n        This is a rural application oriented project which may be helpful to \novercome the new outbreak of chikungunya viral fever.\nMethodology: Quincke’s Method\nFormula used:  K = 2hṕg/H²,Mass susceptibility = 2 hg/H²     \nSummary:                      \nIn  this  we  have  adopted  Quincke’s  method  to  determine  the\nmagnetic susceptibility.\nHere we have taken liquid samples and we determined whether it is Dia,\nPara or Ferro magnet.\n         Para magnetic substances are having positive susceptibility value\nand Diamagnetic substances are having negative susceptibility value, and\nFerromagnetic material is large positive value.\n       Based on the results we concluded the properties of each oil and we\nfounded Paramagnetic materials are the best oils which can be used for\njoint pain relief. \nConclusion:\n         Finally we founded that Paramagnetic materials are the best oils which\ncan be used for joint pain relief. \nProject submitted (B.SC - 2007):\nTitle: Socio & Emotional Climate Of School Students in Dindigul\nDistrict\n                              \nObjective:\nIn this we studied ambience of schools & Emotional characters of School\nstudents in Dindigul District\n               \nMethodology: Descriptive Survey MethodFormula used: Mean, Standard Deviation, Test of Significance\n  \nSummary: \nInitially we have selected 77 secondary students from two different schools.\nWe used stratified random sampling technique which will have more \nstatistical efficient.\n                 \nConclusion:\n      \n      In this  study, the investigator has attempted to study the Socio-\nemotional climate of schools. Since the role of the teacher is very important\nin shaping the personality of the student, it is always necessary to see that\nthe teacher should be well trained not only in academic aspect but also non-\nacademic  aspects.  Emotional  climate  of  schools  should  be  given  due\nimportance in regarding with social climate. For this, the administrator’s role\nis  more  important  in  order  to  maintain  good  socio-emotional  climate  is\nschool.\nAchievements\nM.SC Project was published on “The International Journal of \nluminescence”.\nPersonal Strength\nPositive learning altitude.\nCreative outlook and clarity of thoughts.\nExcellent interpersonal skills.\nSelf motivated, firm determined, workaholic.\nLike to accept challenges.\nPersonal Profile\nFather’s Name             :   N.Kailasam\nDate of Birth                :   10-09-1990\nGender                         :   Female\nNationality                   :   Indian\nMailing Address            :   #7/7, Sri Raghavendra Flats,\n                                             G-4, “Sai Sankalpa”,\n                                             Kuppusami Pillai Street,\n                                             Guduvancheri – 603202.\nHobbies\nEngaging myself participating in Social services among the people who are \nat BPL (Below poverty line), Listening and Playing Music.Yours Faithfully\n(K.MEENAKSHI)",
