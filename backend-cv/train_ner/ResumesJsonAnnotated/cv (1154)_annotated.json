EXPERIENCE \nSUMMARY 20 Years experience encompassing the following areas: \n• Effects of fluctuating grou ndwater levels on vegetation \n• Natural vegetation responses to environmental stresses such as drought & \nshade \n• Modeling of plant physiological and biomass responses to a range of \nenvironmental factors \n• Sampling of vegetation conditions & surveys of forest, range & shrub \necosystems \n• Evaluation of vegetation dynamics over time \n• Plant propagation & greenhouse maintenance \n• Chemical analyses of plant tissues for nutritional quality and 2\no compounds \n• Statistical analyses & data management \nSELECTED \nPROJECT EXPERIENCE \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n Environmental Consultant to Individual Dairy Producers and Dairy \nProducers of New Mexico, GGI. Worked on environmental compliance and \npermitting for individual dairies and collected and compiled literature on the fate of hormones associated with concentrated animal feeding operations. Ecological Consultant to City of Los Angeles, Pacifica Services, Inc.   \nAs part of a large-scale project ensuring future water supply to the city of Los \nAngeles and the maintenance of healthy vegetation in Owens Valley, I \nmanaged several tasks within the proj ect: successional v egetation dynamics \nfollowing agricultural abandonment; relationship between groundwater depth \nand individual plant species; relationship between vegetation productivity and \nwater availability. I managed and budgeted tasks, participated in project \nmeetings, and coordinated with client personnel. I designed experiments and \nsupervised staff in vegetation data colle ction, collected and analyzed vegetation \ndynamics data in relation to groundwater levels, and authored manuscripts, reports and presentations. I further parameterized and assisted with EDYS \nupdates, a landscape-level ecological model. 2003 - 2005 \nVisiting Professor and Postdoctoral Research Assistant, University of \nNevada, Las Vegas. Analyzed environmental and physiological factors \naffecting photosynthesis in desert shrubs under ambient and elevated CO\n2 to \ndevelop seasonal gas exchange model . Designed field and greenhouse \nexperiments and participated in proposal  writing. Supervised undergraduate \nassistants. 2000 – 2002 \nEcophysiological Research Assistant, Duke University   \nDesigned and conducted experiments testi ng for species differences in dynamic \nphotosynthetic responses to changes in light intensity in ambient and elevated \nCO 2. Coded and parameterized dynamic photosynthesis model. Maintained \nphotosynthesis analyzers, data logger s, “baby-Kucera” sapflow gauges, \nradiation sensors. 1996 - 2000 \nEcological Research Assistant, Northern Arizona University  \nDesigned and conducted field study on the relationship between ponderosa \npine stand structure, light environm ent and grass species presence and \nabundance as well as a greenhouse experiment evaluating effect of shade on \nnative grass species. Hired, trained,  and supervised student workers for \nbiomass harvest. Assisted professor in writing McIntire-Stennis proposal to fund thesis research. 1994 - 1996 Chemical Research Technician, Northern Arizona University  \nSet up laboratory and gas chromatographs for resin acid and terpene analysis. \nAdapted resin acid analysis to ponderosa pine needles. 1994 \nGreenhouse Research Aide, Northern Arizona University  \nPropagated and maintained tree seedlings  in greenhouse facility for field Elke Naumburg Resume   \n 2SELECTED \nPROJECT EXPERIENCE   \n(con’t) transplanting. Installed drip irrigation.  Analyzed terpenes in ponderosa pine \nneedles. Supervised and trained high school summer workers. 1991 - 1993 Agricultural Research Assistant, T echnical University Munich, Germany \nOversaw vegetable experiments and anal yzed their nutritional quality; handled \ndata/statistical analyses; supervised/trained apprentices. 1986 – 1990 \nFIELD EQUIPMENT Analyzed hemispherical photographs, evaluated hydraulic conductivity and \nsusceptibility to cavitation by plant stems (centrifuge method), used and \nserviced photosynthesis analyzers (C IRAS I, LI 6400), data loggers (Campbell, \nDelta-T, LI 1000), spectroradiometer (L I 1600), “Baby Kucera” sapflow system, \nradiation sensors (GaAsP 1118 photodiodes by Hamamatsu, LI-190), leaf area \nmeters (CID, AgVis video camera/compu ter system) & Scion Image software. \nUtilized woody and herbaceous v egetation survey procedures. \nEDUCATION \nPhD Plant Physiological Ecology, Duke University, 2000 \nMS Forest Ecology, Universi ty of Northern Arizona, 1996 \nBS Forest Management ( summa cum laude ), University of Northern Arizona, 1994 \nSCIENTIFIC \nPUBLICATIONS \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  Barker, DH ; Vanier, C; Naumburg , E; Charlet, TN; Nielsen, KM; Newingham, BA; \nSmith, SD. 2006.
