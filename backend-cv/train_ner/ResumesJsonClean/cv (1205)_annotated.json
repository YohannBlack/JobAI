  "text": "Juan Antonio AGUILAR-GARIB\nJuan  Antonio  AGUILAR-GARIB  is  a  Full  Time  Professor  at  the  Facultad  de  Ingeniería\nMecánica  y  Eléctrica  (FIME,  School  of  Mechanical  and  Electrical  Engineering)  of  the\nUniversidad  Autónoma  de  Nuevo  León  (UANL)  in  the  Graduate  Program  in  Materials\nEngineering. He is a Mechanical Engineer and Science Master in Metallurgy graduated of the\nInstituto  Tecnológico  de  Saltillo  in  México,  and  earned  a  doctoral  degree  in  Materials\nEngineering by the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (1991).\nIn 1994, founded by CONACYT (Mexican Council for Science and Technology) and UANL,\nstarted his research about microwave processing of materials, mostly ceramics. Therefore, Dr.\nAGUILAR-GARIB spent a year in 1997 in the Center for Energy Studies, later the Center for\nEnergy and Environmental Resources at The University of Texas at Austin, in a laboratory\ncalled “Process Energetics”.\nIn 2005 graduated a doctor under a cotutelle agreement (the first one at FIME) through a\nresearch collaboration of the UANL (with ANUIES) and the Université Paul Sabatier (with\nECOS, France) entitled \"Sintering of nickel manganese compounds by means of microwaves\".\nThis collaboration continued with the support of PCP (Program for Graduate Cooperation) with\nthe same universities and two companies, Kemet de Mexico and Marion Technologies, from\nFrance, and a second doctor was graduated under the same agreement with the work “Thickness\nreduction of ceramic layers based on BaTiO 3 for capacitors”, and in 2014 a new proposal about\nconductive phases in ceramics was granted.\nDr. AGUILAR-GARIB has been honored by academia and research. He is a member of the\nSistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican System for Researching); of the Academic Group\n“Science and Engineering of Nanomaterials” since 2015, after being member of the gropu\n“Synthesis and Characterization of Materials” since 2003 (PROMEP) at FIME, member de la\nUANL; and of the Mexican Academy of Sciences. He has participated in 2009 and 2011 in the\nChair of Mexican Studies at the Université de Toulouse, Le Mirail. He earned the Research\nAward UANL in 1991 for the work \"Development of a topochemical model of reduction of iron\nore”. As part of a team he earned the same award in 2001 for the work \"Effect of iron over the\nsintering, order parameter and morphology of a spinel of the system Al 2O3-MgO-Fe2O3\"; in\n2003 (granted in 2004) for the work \"Synthesis of MgAl 2O4 at low temperatures with additions\nof CaCO3\"; and in 2012 for the work “Design of slips for producing ultrathin ceramic tapes for\ncapacitors by tape casting”. In 2000 he earned with a team, the TECNOS Award of Technology\nfor the work \"Iron oxide layer formation over the walls of direct reduction ore reactors\".\nDr. AGUILAR-GARIB is the Head Editor of Revista  Ingenierías of FIME and the Editor in\nChief of the Journal of Microwave Power and Electromagnetic Energy.\nThe  interest  areas  of  Dr.  AGUILAR-GARIB  consider  application  of  technology  for\noptimization of processes, decision making supported by scientific foundations, considering\nenergetic  and  environmental  aspects,  with  novel  technologies  for  supplying  energy  to  the\nprocesses and development of know-how, based on scientific aspects, applied to materials\nprocessing.\nhttp://grafito.fime.uanl.mx/",
