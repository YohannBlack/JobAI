Ms. Naumburg managed and budgeted tasks, \nparticipated in project meetings, and coordinated with client \npersonnel. She designed experiments and supervised staff in \nvegetation data collection, collected and analyzed vegetation \ndynamics data in relation to groundwater levels, and authored \nmanuscripts, reports and presentations. She further parameterized \nand assisted with EDYS updates, a landscape-level ecological model. \n2003 - 2005\nPostdoctoral Research Assistant, University of Nevada, Las \nVegas. Analyzed environmental and physiological factors affecting \nphotosynthesis in desert shrubs under ambient and elevated CO 2 to \ndevelop seasonal gas exchange model. Designed field and \ngreenhouse experiments and participated in proposal writing. \nSupervised undergraduate assistants. 2000 – 2002\nEcophysiological Research Assistant, Duke University  \nDesigned and conducted experiments testing for species differences \nin dynamic photosynthetic responses to changes in light intensity in \nambient and elevated CO 2. Coded and parameterized dynamic \nphotosynthesis model. Maintained photosynthesis analyzers, data \nloggers, “baby-Kucera” sapflow gauges, radiation sensors. 1996 - \n2000\nEcological Research Assistant, Northern Arizona University\nDesigned and conducted field study on the relationship between \nponderosa pine stand structure, light environment and grass species \npresence and abundance as well as a greenhouse experiment \nevaluating effect of shade on native grass species. Hired, trained, and\nsupervised student workers for biomass harvest. Assisted professor in\nwriting McIntire-Stennis proposal to fund thesis research. 1994 - 1996\nChemical Research Technician, Northern Arizona University\nElke Naumburg Resume 1SELECTED \nPROJECT \nEXPERIENCE\n(con’t)Set up laboratory and gas chromatographs for resin acid and terpene \nanalysis. Adapted resin acid analysis to ponderosa pine needles. 1994\nGreenhouse Research Aide, Northern Arizona University\nPropagated and maintained tree seedlings in greenhouse facility for \nfield transplanting. Installed drip irrigation. Analyzed terpenes in \nponderosa pine needles. Supervised and trained high school summer \nworkers. 1991 - 1993\nAgricultural Research Assistant, Technical University Munich, \nGermany\nOversaw vegetable experiments and analyzed their nutritional \nquality; handled data/statistical analyses; supervised and trained \nassistants and apprentices. 1986 - 1990\nEDUCATION PhD Plant Physiological Ecology, Duke University, 2000\nMS Forest Ecology, University of Northern Arizona, 1996\nBS Forest Management, University of Northern Arizona, 1994\nSELECTED \nPUBLICATIONSBarker, DH ; Vanier, C; Naumburg, E; Charlet, TN; Nielsen, KM; Newingham, BA; Smith, SD. 2006.Enhanced monsoon precipitation and N deposition affect leaf traits and photosynthesis differently in spring and summer in the desert shrub Larrea tridentata.
